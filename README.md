# Novel-Sampling-Design-Algorithm
The code in this R script contains the Monte Carlo algorithm used to perform simulations and conduct analyses in the paper A Novel Cluster Sampling Design that Couples Three Surveys to support Multiple Statistical Modeling Objectives.

The script is written in the R statistical programming language. It takes as input data sets that contain summary information about health systems and owner subsidiaries and their underlying hospitals and physician practices. I am currently exploring whether these data sets can be included in the repository. Just two files need to be added. Their filenames are: jachmg-2017-02-27.csv, jcps-joss-2017-02-26.csv
